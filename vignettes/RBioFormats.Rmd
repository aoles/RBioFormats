# Introduction

`r Biocpkg('RBioFormats')` provides an interface from R to the OME
[Bio-Formats](https://github.com/ome/bioformats) Java library. Bio-Formats is a
solution for reading data of various image types, including many popular in life
sciences as well as proprietary microscopy image formats. It supports over 150
file formats from domains such as High Content Screening, time lapse imaging,
digital pathology and other complex multidimensional image formats.

Image pixel data is typically complemented by image metadata containing, for
example, technical and temporal parameters of the acquisition in the case of
microscopy images. Such annotation can be an invaluable source of additional
insight helpful during postprocessing or analyzing of the image data.

The package builds on top of the infrastructure provided by 
`r Biocpkg('EBImage')` by extending its class abstracting image data. The
primary motivation behind developing `r Biocpkg('RBioFormats')` was to fill the
gap between data acquisition and analysis by providing a tool which allows to
directly read the acquired images without the need of any tedious image format
conversion in between.

The following chapters provide some practical examples illustrating the use of
the package. Along the way the classes used for representing image data and
metadata are described too.


# Getting started

`r Biocpkg("RBioFormats")` is an R package distributed as part of the
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) project. To install the package, start R
(version 4.2 or higher) and enter:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("RBioFormats")
```

Once `r Biocpkg("RBioFormats")` is installed, it can be loaded by the following
command.

```{r library}
library("RBioFormats")
```


# Reading images

Images can be loaded into R with the help of the package function `read.image`.
The following examples illustrates how to load a sample grayscale image

```{r readgrey}
f <- system.file("images", "sample.png", package = "EBImage")

img <- read.image(f)
img
```

or an RGB image.

```{r readrgb}
f <- system.file("images", "sample-color.png", package = "EBImage")

img <- read.image(f)
print(img, short = TRUE)
```

Note the use of `short = TRUE` argument to `print` in the example above for
displaying object summary without the image data preview. There is also a
convenience function to query just for the order of dimensions.

```{r dimorder}
dimorder(img)
```


# The *AnnotatedImage* class

`r Rpackage('RBioFormats')` stores image data in an *AnnotatedImage* class which
extends the *Image* class from `r Biocpkg('EBImage')`.

```{r classdef}
getClassDef("AnnotatedImage")
```

Compared to the original *Image* class the *AnnotatedImage* class features an
additional `metadata` slot containing image metadata.

```{r metadata}
meta <- metadata(img)
meta
```

To alter the length of the printed output use the `list.len` attribute to
`print`.

```{r printmeta}
print(meta, list.len = 99L)
```


# Image metadata

Image metadata is represented by an *ImageMetadata* class structured as a named
list of coreMetadata, globalMetadata and seriesMetadata.

```{r metaNames}
names(meta)
cMeta <- meta$coreMetadata
names( cMeta )
```

`coreMetadata` stores information which is guaranteed to exist for any image
type, whereas the latter two metadata types are format-specific and can be
empty.

Each of these metadata sublists has an corresponding accessor function, e.g.,

```{r coreMetadata}
identical( coreMetadata(meta), cMeta)
```

and similarly for `globalMetadata` and `seriesMetadata`.  These accessors are
useful for extracting the corresponding metadata directly from an
*AnnotatedImage* object

```{r coreMetadata2}
identical( coreMetadata(img), cMeta )
```


# Working with large data sets

The `read.metadata` function allows to access image metadata without loading the
corresponding pixel data.

```{r read.metadata}
f <- system.file("images", "nuclei.tif", package = "EBImage")
metadata <- read.metadata(f)

metadata
```

This approach is especially useful when working with image series and/or stacks
which have high memory requirements. Information from the metadata can be used
as input to functions which read and process the data chunk-wise rather than
loading it all at once. For this purpose the `subset` argument to `read.image`
comes in handy. Just to give you an idea the following toy example iterates over
individual time frames.  Similarly a region if interest from within individual
image frames could be extracted by providing ranges on the `X` and `Y` planar
dimensions. To subset image series specify them in the `series` argument.

```{r read.image slices, eval=FALSE}
for(t in seq_len(coreMetadata(metadata)$sizeT)) {
  frame <- read.image(f, subset = list(T = t))
  # perform some operations on each `frame`
}
```


# OME-XML representation

The OME-XML DOM tree representation of the metadata can be accessed using tools
from the `r CRANpkg('XML')` or `r CRANpkg('xml2')` package.  For details on
working with XML data in R see the corresponding package's documentation.

```{r parseXML, message=FALSE}
library("xml2")

omexml <- read.omexml(f)
read_xml(omexml)
```


# Session info {.unnumbered}

Here is the output of `sessionInfo()` on the system on which this
document was compiled:

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

# Appendix A: Working with test images {.unnumbered}

For development purposes it is useful to have images of a specific size or pixel
type for testing. Mock files containing gradient images can be generated with

```{r mockFile, out.width='256px', out.height='256px'}
f <- mockFile(sizeX = 256, sizeY = 256)
img <- read.image(f)

library("EBImage")
display(img, method = "raster")
```

Note that the native image data range is different depending on pixel type.

```{r defaultRange, echo=FALSE, results='asis', R.options=list(digits = 15)}
types <- c("int8", "uint8", "int16", "uint16", "int32", "uint32", "float", "double")

ranges <- sapply(types, function(t) {
  minmax <- FormatTools$defaultMinMax(FormatTools$pixelTypeFromString(t))
  setNames(minmax, c("min", "max"))
  })
knitr::kable(ranges)
```

Image data returned by `r Biocpkg('RBioFormats')` is by default scaled to the
[0:1] range. This behavior can be controlled using the `normalize` argument to
`read.image`.

```{r range}
sapply(types, function(t) {
  img <- read.image(mockFile(sizeX = 65536, sizeY = 11, pixelType = t), normalize = FALSE)
  if (typeof(img)=="raw") 
    img <- readBin(img, what = "int", n = length(img), size = 1L)
  setNames(range(img), c("min", "max"))  
})
```

# Appendix B: Compared to *EBImage* {.unnumbered}

Loading images using `r Biocpkg('RBioFormats')` should give the same results as
using the `r Biocpkg('EBImage')` package.

```{r comparewithref}
library("EBImage")
f <- system.file("images", "sample-color.png", package = "EBImage")
identical(readImage(f), as.Image(read.image(f)))
```
